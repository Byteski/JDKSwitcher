## JDKSwitcher
JDKSwitcher is a batch file that you can switch JDK Versions easily without looking for Environment Variables.

## Instructions
- Make sure to have .bat file on any specific location and just run it, you'll know it.
- Make sure that you have [JAVA_HOME](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2619584/how-to-set-java-home-on-windows-7) written on Environment Variables Window.
- When you're trying to install Java SE, make sure to install Oracle Java, because if you install OpenJDK, then you need to modify that batch file.
